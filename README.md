# Warp Info Panel

## About

Replaces the default warp drive widget with one that auto-updates the amount of warp cells needed. Good when partially slowboating a route.

## Installation

1) Copypasta the content of the two files into a new start() filter and a new tick() filter respectively.
2) Make sure you check the naming of the slots for the core and the warp drive.
