# Warp Info Panel (WIP)

## About

This is still very much work in progress. Might not always show the correct cell amount.

Adds a warp info widget that – unlike the default one – continuously auto-updates the amount of warp cells needed. Useful when partially slowboating a route.

## Installation

0) Can be run with a control seat or programming board.
1) Copypasta the content of the two files into a new start() filter and a new tick() filter respectively.
2) Make sure you check the naming of the slots for the core and the warp drive.
